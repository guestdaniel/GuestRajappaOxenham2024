This is the code and data repository for Guest, Rajappa, and Oxenham (2024).

## Workflow
To reproduce our results, you must have an appropriate data file located in `data/exp_pro`.

1. From raw data files, one can compile them into an experiment-specific CSV file using `process.R` (needs to be updated for new experiments). This should yield...

2. Julia code can be used to plot each experimental result

## Experiments
Here, the word "experiment" refers to a single AFC protocol and its resultant data.
